            <h1>I just want to say something</h1>
            <p>
                If you were the sun<br>
                I would still stare at you<br>
                Even if u lose my vision<br>
                And looked down one as far as I could<br>
                Because the last thing I saw is perfection<br>
                <br>
                But i will never get a chance to embrace you<br>
                Your warmth is like a fires Play<br>
                Would calm me first then burn me at the end<br>
                <br>
                We are as far from unity; that time itself ages on the ways<br>
                With the world against me and choose or my side<br>
                I am down like fool with pride<br>
                crumbling resting and dusting away<br>
                My sins are against my life<br>
                Never did anything good to claim me down<br>
                I can never keep you ,<br>
                Please you as I am always the worst for you<br>
                Fatality follows me<br>
                Happiness never comes near me<br>
                Fearing its own end<br>
                Is something I pretend<br>
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                I will keep it short and I don't want to waste your time.
                I want to confess something to you. It has been eating me from inside for 3 years.
                Dekho<br>
                I fell in love with you the first time I saw you that was in class 10th. And with God's grace we became friends.
                I did not had the courage to ask you but deep in my heart I praised every small action of yours.
                For me you are the most beautifull person in the world. And The great Artist that ever lived.<br>
                <br>
                I dont want to affect you .. for some people love is like spoiling each other life . I want to spoil you too in such a way that whenever you feel lonely i would be there for you to support you . I want myself to be yours that you can always count on me . I want ki it should be me and you against the problem<br>
                <br>
                For me you will be the Greatest Artist till my death. Will you shape my life for me.<br>
                <br>
                Will you be my Partner for Rest of your Life and shape my future the way you like ??
